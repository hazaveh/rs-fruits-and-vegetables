# 🍎🥕 Fruits and Vegetables

## Notes for the 🚙 🏄🏻 reviewer
* The test suites should run all the functionality, you can run the `composer test` command to run the entire test suite as well as `phpstan`.
* codestyles can be tested and fixed by `composer cs:check` & `composer cs:fix`
* I have updated the minimum php dependency to 8.2 I wanted to make use of constructor property promotion
* I have used `pest` testing framework for writing the tests. tests include functional and unit suites, they also cover database testing.


## 🎯 Goal
We want to build a service which will take a `request.json` and:
* Process the file and create two separate collections for `Fruits` and `Vegetables`
* Each collection has methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `list()`;
* Units have to be stored as grams;
* Store the collections in a storage engine of your choice. (e.g. Database, In-memory)
* Provide an API endpoint to query the collections. As a bonus, this endpoint can accept filters to be applied to the returning collection.
* Provide another API endpoint to add new items to the collections (i.e., your storage engine).
* As a bonus you might:
  * consider giving option to decide which units are returned (kilograms/grams);
  * how to implement `search()` method collections;
  * use latest version of Symfony's to embbed your logic 

### ✔️ How can I check if my code is working?
You have two ways of moving on:
* You call the Service from PHPUnit test like it's done in dummy test (just run `bin/phpunit` from the console)

or

* You create a Controller which will be calling the service with a json payload

## 💡 Hints before you start working on it
* Keep KISS, DRY, YAGNI, SOLID principles in mind
* Timebox your work - we expect that you would spend between 3 and 4 hours.
* Your code should be tested

## When you are finished
* Please upload your code to a public git repository (i.e. GitHub, Gitlab)
